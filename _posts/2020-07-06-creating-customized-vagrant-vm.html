		<h3>The Problem Statement</h3>
		<p>
			I use Vagrant very heavily in my daya to day work. That means I have to create and destroy virtual machines at a very past rate.
			Now every time I create a new VM, all the set of basic tools and dependncies needs to be reinstalled - sheer waste to time and n/w resources(especially on a slow network).
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>
        	I decided to create a base image with all basic tools I use and publish it to Vagrant Cloud and use it in my subsequent VM's. So if this fits your use case too, follow along....
        </p>
        <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
        <ul>
        	<li>Vagrant Cloud Account</li>
			<li>md5sum installed</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Steps to follow</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><h6>Create a directory for Vagrant</h6>
				<pre><code>--authorization-mode=RBAC</code></pre>
				<code>
					cd ~
					mkdir centos7

				</code>
				<h5>Prepare your VM from any base image</h5>
				<p>Use the below configuration to prepare your base image</p>
				<code>Testing</code>
			</li>
Package the vm into a file with .box extension with the below commands
vagrant package --output centos7.box
Then calculate the md5 cchecksum for your created image
md5sum centos.box
Then publish it over the Vagrant hub
