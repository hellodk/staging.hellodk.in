##### Professional Summary:
Armed with the drive, motivation and self-determination to succeed, I have continually provided above average results while also learning and developing along the way. I work extremely well independently as well as within a team to deliver measurable results based on the business goals. I am a responsible, self-motivated, smart working, dedicated and always considerate of others.

I come from a Java background where I have been developing several tools and solutions over Java and it’s associated frameworks like Spring/Struts using the Agile methodology.

I have primarily been building tools for SysOps/DevOps which can vary from automating tools to monitoring services, web applications, exposing restful API's or creating interfaces using CORBA to facilitate communication between systems deployed over diverse platforms and have also extensively worked with messaging queue services like Rabbitmq and Apache Kafka. I was responsible for the setup, clustering and monitoring/maintaining the entire fleet of messaging services(both RabbitMQ and Kafka) which served as a mechanism for intercommunication to over 300 microservices in HA mode without downtime.
Besides I have also been working on Blockchain Technology and have developed a few projects on Blockchain and created own cryptocurrency for testing/learning purpose.

Implemented Disaster Recovery management system over Docker and Kubernetes and also migrated existing pre-prod and staging environments over Docker.
I also have also contributed extensively in making different dashboards as part of key performance indicators for multiple clients and have architectured scalable cloud-based(AWS/Azure) applications with extensive use of load balancing tools like HA Proxy, Nginx.

Currently, I am working as a Corporate Trainer, where I train people from various organisations across the globe primarily on DevOps tools and techniques.

###### Projects Summary:
- Disaster Recovery
Creating DR infrastructure, requirement gathering and creation of Kubernetes cluster on bare metal servers and implementing the deployment pipelines - blue-green and canary
Infrastructure & service monitoring, sending alerts over slack and SMS

- Payments Service:
Create payments service for facilitating payments transactions using Java and Spring Boot and implementing analytics with Talend to monitor the payments/orders. Invoved in Sprint Planning, Requirement gathering, Architecture planning, writing unit test-cases, coding configuration of the cluster, managing shards/replicas of the payments database, coordinating UAT and SIT and load tests

- Centralized Log Management:
To monitor logs centrally, we needed a powerful tool. Elasticsearch is what we choose for this project and developed on top of Java using Spring Cloud. Initiated the requirement gathering, created UML diagrams, architecture planning, automated deployment & configuration of the cluster, managing shards and the replicas for elasticsearch cluster, analytics on the data using talend

- PCI Compliance:
Ensured the Payments setup is PCI DSS compliant by creating network segmentations for servers(DMZ environment) and implementing Intrusion Detection Systems(OSSEC/Alienvault) & patching(Spacewalk) the air gapped systems. Responsible for getting the VAPT(Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing)

- Apollo:
App deployment via one click using Ansible, Docker and Kubernetes by  automatically creating templates for tasks using jinja2 templating systems and wrote executors, setting up Jenkins jobs etc.

- Sethji:
Track AWS/Azure Billing Charges
Bill analysis using ETL & Setup the billing management stack on python and flask
reduced billing costs by 25% by identifying overprovisioned/unused services etc.

- Graphite Grafana Integration:
monitor services, function calls, throughput, response code status, revenue etc.
Requirement gathering, UML, coding, writing automation, configuration and deployment on Python

- Monitoring Setup:
Monitoring for complete Infrastructure
Setup monitoring for our infrastructure(hybrid) over Icinga2/Zabbix and Talend
Ensured High Availability of Services

- Daily Operations:
Day to day operations
Developing new features over Java/Python/Golang
Security Audit - Implemented IDS, DDOS mitigation via fail2ban
packet tracing/filtering using Wireshark

DNS, LDAP, Monitoring, Load Balancing over Nginx/HA Proxy
setup network planning for infrastructure migration
reduce data transfer costs & improved performance
subnet planning helped reduce the complexity of whitelisting services/IP’s
Helped setup Azure account with basic services like DNS, LDAP, monitoring

- Clickstream Analytics
A single point to handle all clickstream data and do analytics on that
Integrating the existing SQL databases with ETL(Talend) and creating dashboards
