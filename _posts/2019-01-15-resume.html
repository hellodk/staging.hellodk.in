<h3>
	Professional Summary:
</h3>
<p>
Armed with the drive, motivation and self-determination to succeed, I have continually provided above average results while also learning and developing along the way. I work extremely well independently as well as within a team to deliver measurable results based on the business goals. I am a responsible, self-motivated, smart working, dedicated and always considerate of others.
</p>
<p>
I come from a Java background where I have been developing several tools and solutions over Java and it's associated frameworks like Spring/Struts using the Agile methodology.
</p>
I have primarily been building tools for SysOps/DevOps which can vary from automating tools to monitoring services, web applications, exposing restful API's or creating interfaces using CORBA to facilitate communication between systems deployed over diverse platforms and have also extensively worked with messaging queue services like Rabbitmq and Apache Kafka. I was responsible for the setup, clustering and monitoring/maintaining the entire fleet of messaging services(both RabbitMQ and Kafka) which served as a mechanism for intercommunication to over 300 microservices in HA mode without downtime.
Besides I have also been working on Blockchain Technology and have developed a few projects on Blockchain and created own cryptocurrency for testing/learning purpose.
</p>
<p>
Implemented Disaster Recovery management system over Docker and Kubernetes and also migrated existing pre-prod and staging environments over Docker.
I also have also contributed extensively in making different dashboards as part of key performance indicators for multiple clients and have architectured scalable cloud-based(AWS/Azure) applications with extensive use of load balancing tools like HA Proxy, Nginx.
</p>
<p>
Currently, I am working as a Corporate Trainer, where I train people from various organisations across the globe primarily on DevOps tools and techniques.
