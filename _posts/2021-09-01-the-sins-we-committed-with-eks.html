Kubernetes is vast - Very very vast, vaster is the pace at which Kubernetes is growing and new developments on Kubernetes and it's supporting tools are getting pitched into.

What works for today may not work after one month, reasons can be numerous - The CRD's hacebeen upgraded. Operator is updated. The functionality has been depreciated, The object implementation has moved to a new API group etc.

I'm going to share a few of the thoughts and learning that we shoud be careful of while working with Kubernetes, specially the managed ones.

<ul>
<li>Docker Images</li>
Scan all docker images for vulnerabilities before ussing them in the k8s ecosystem. There are plenty of tools available like 
Anchore Engine
CoreOS/Clair
Vuls.io
OpenScap

<li>Patched Images</li>

<li>PRIVATE repository</li>
We have the control
Safe from reaching the pull limits as in case of Docker Image Pull limits
Single Repository for the entire organisation(Production/Staging)
Less Management Overhead
More control over the image life cycles
Prevents repetition of the same images across AWS Accounts or Repositories - Cost-Effective
All images should be customised to the minimum of
timezones should be updated and also alert should be made to track timezones across the pods/containers
If there is a patch available, then it should be patched as well
Pipeline for the automatic finding of images and building and patching
