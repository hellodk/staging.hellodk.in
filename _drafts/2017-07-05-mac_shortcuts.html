<h3>Keyboard Tips</h3>
<ol>
<li>The Delete key works like Backspace if you are from other platforms. To delete on the other direction, press Fn + Delete</li>
<li>The Backspace will feel slow by default. This can be changed in Keyboard Preferences by making "Key Repeat" fast & "Delay Until Repeat" short. Ref: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=508385 </li>
<li>If you are missing Home & End keys, it is Command+ Left Arrow & Command + Right Arrow</li>
<li>If you are missing Page Up & Down keys, it is Command+ Up Arrow & Command + Down Arrow</li>
 
<h3>Mouse/Trackpad Tips:</h3>
To Drag something, Select Text, you can press the mouse button and drag it. If you are familiar with Double Tap & Drag like in Windows, Linux, You can have the same settings enabled in System Preferences > Universal Access > Mouse & Trackpad >Trackpad Options -> Enable Dragging Without Lock.
