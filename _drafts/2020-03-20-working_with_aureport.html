<p>In this tutorial we will talk about the different techniques how we can use aureport to report ssh login attempts.
</p>

What is aureport?
aureport is a command line utility used for creating useful summary reports from the audit log files stored in /var/log/audit/. Like ausearch, it also accepts raw log data from stdin.

It is an easy-to-use utility; simply pass an option for a specific kind of report that you need, as shown in the examples below.

Create Report Concerning Audit Rule Keys
The aurepot command will produce a report about all keys you specified in audit rules, using the -k flag.

# aureport -k 
Report Audit Rule Keys
Report Audit Rule Keys

You can enable interpreting of numeric entities into text (for example convert UID to account name) using the -i option.

# aureport -k -i
Create Report About Attempted Authentications
If you need a report about all events relating to attempted authentications for all users, use the -au option.

# aureport -au 
OR
# aureport -au -i
Summary of Login Authentication
Summary of Login Authentication

Produce Report Concerning Logins
The -l option tells aureport to generate a report of all logins as follows.

Check Login Authentications
Check Login Authentications

Report Failed Events on the System
The following command shows how to report all failed events.

# aureport --failed
Report Failed Events
Report Failed Events

Generate Summary Report for a Given Time Period
It is also possible to generate reports for a specified period of time; the -ts defines the start date/time and -te sets a end date/time. You can also use words like now, recent, today, yesterday, this-week, week-ago, this-month, this-year instead of actual time formats.

# aureport -ts 09/19/2017 15:20:00 -te now --summary -i 
OR
# aureport -ts yesterday -te now --summary -i

Produce report From Different Audit Log File
If you want to create a report from a different file other than the default log files in /var/log/audit directory, use the -if flag to specify the file.

This command reports all logins recorded in /var/log/tecmint/hosts/node1.log.

# aureport -l -if /var/log/tecmint/hosts/node1.log 
You can find all options and more information in the aureport man page.

# man aureport
